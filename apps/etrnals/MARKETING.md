# Etrnals Lore

Etrnals are engineered apex signatures that stabilize the Etrna continuum. Nine species, each forged from distinct cosmic labs, act as guardians for liquidity, identity, and creation across Etrna L1 and every EVM bridge.

## Species intros
- **Solari** — Emits solar rails that subsidize bridges and swaps during peak heat windows.
- **Nyx** — Master of shadow routes, boosting privacy-friendly swaps and dark-forest protection.
- **Aether** — Keeper of low-latency relays, reducing oracle lag for omnichain intents.
- **Mireborn** — Biotech chemists that supercharge crafting quests and toxin labs.
- **Flux** — Liquid staking tacticians that rebalance yield for $ETR/$VIBE LPs.
- **Helix** — Geneticists that recombine traits to spawn rare legendaries.
- **Runebound** — Spellwrights unlocking cross-chain enchantments and rune sockets.
- **Obsidian** — Sentinel walls preventing slashing, fraud, and downtime.
- **Aurora** — Creator-centric muse that unlocks UX airdrops, skins, and collab drops.

## Legendary variants
Legendary frames appear at a 2% mint probability and add a +15% multiplier to both $VIBE and $ETR staking rewards. They also unlock seasonal quests that drip expedition keys and governance boosts.

## Visual prompts
- Cosmic lab corridors drenched in neon, nine biomes separated by glass, each showing a species core.
- Solar dragon made of lattice light, wings trailing plasma over a liquid bridge.
- Shadow wolf with holographic runes, stepping through a portal of compressed code.
- Aurora whale swimming through voxel clouds above a megacity, leaving a gradient wake.
